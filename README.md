This is a personal timer for my next birthday in 2023

## Things I learned
Used setInterval to update innerHTML every second

## Planned Update
Currently the countdown is hardcoded to January 20th of 2023. Change it so that the countodwn automatically resets to the next January 20th when it reaches my birthday
